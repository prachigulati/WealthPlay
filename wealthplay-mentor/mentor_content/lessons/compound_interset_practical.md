## Lesson: Compound Interest in Real Life

Compound Interest = interest earned on original investment + previous years' interest.

### Example 1: No Compounding

₹10,000 earning 10% simple interest yearly:

Year 1: ₹1,000  
Year 2: ₹1,000  
5 years total interest: ₹5,000  
Total: ₹15,000  

### Example 2: With Compounding

₹10,000 at 10% compound interest:

| Year | Amount |
|------|--------|
| 1 | ₹11,000 |
| 2 | ₹12,100 |
| 3 | ₹13,310 |
| 4 | ₹14,641 |
| 5 | ₹16,105 |

Difference after 5 years: ₹1,105 extra — without extra effort.

Consistency beats intensity.
