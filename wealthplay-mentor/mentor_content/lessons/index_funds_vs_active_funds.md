## Lesson: Index Funds vs Active Funds

### Index Fund:
Tracked performance of a stock market index like NIFTY 50.

➡️ Low fee  
➡️ Stable  
➡️ Good for beginners

### Active Fund:
Managed by experts who try to outperform the market.

➡️ Sometimes higher returns  
➡️ Higher fees  
➡️ Not guaranteed wins

### Rule:
If unsure → start with **index funds.**
