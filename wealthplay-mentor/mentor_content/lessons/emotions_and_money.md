## Lesson: Emotions & Money — Behavioral Investing

Money decisions are not 100% logical.

### Cognitive Biases:

| Bias | Example |
|------|---------|
| Herd Mentality | "Everyone is buying this IPO so I should too." |
| Loss Aversion | Fear of loss leads to panic selling |
| Confirmation Bias | Only looking for information that agrees with our belief |

### How to stay calm:
- Automate SIPs
- Review quarterly
- Follow a plan, not emotions
